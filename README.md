# 🧠 AI-Litigator: Fighting Corporate Fraud with GPT-4 & Prompt Engineering


> 🔗 Live case context: [Legal Filing on eDaakhil](#) | [RTI Filed](#) | [Media Story (Coming Soon)](#)
 

> **A real-world legal battle against Acer India — filed, escalated, and fortified using LLMs, prompt chaining, and AI-driven legal workflows.**

This project showcases how I used **OpenAI's GPT-4**, NLP workflows, and prompt engineering strategies to **file a ₹2.55 lakh consumer case** without a lawyer — and how I built a repeatable system to automate grievance redressal, RTI drafting, and regulatory escalation.

From drafting notarized affidavits to handling portal rejections, from filing RTIs to planning a CCPA escalation — every legal step was designed, adapted, and executed through carefully structured prompts and AI toolchains.

This is not a demo.  
This is a blueprint for how **AI can fight fraud, systemize justice, and empower individuals.**

## 🙌 Why This Matters

- 💼 Demonstrates that individuals can fight large corporations using AI and law
- ⚖️ Builds public accountability pipelines using CCPA, BIS, and RTI
- 🧠 Sets a reproducible blueprint for future AI-powered legal battles
- 👨‍💻 Equips prompt engineers, legaltech builders, and solo litigants with real-world use cases

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Use GPT-4 and NLP prompts to draft legally sound complaints, notices, and affidavits
- Apply LLM-based summarization and tone refinement to handle scrutiny, email chains, and court filings
- File the case via government portals (eDaakhil) and prepare escalation to RTI, CCPA, BIS
- Package the full case into a reusable format for prompt engineers, legal tech builders, and solo litigants

## 🧠 NLP & Prompt Engineering Skills Used

| Category | Technique | Use Case |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| 🧠 NLP | Summarization | Call recordings, email denial chains |
| 🧠 NLP | Classification | Emotion tone of support calls, service denial logic |
| 📘 Prompt Design | Zero-shot / few-shot prompting | Complaint, affidavit, scrutiny replies |
| 🔁 Prompt Chaining | Iterative refinement | Legal notice → email → escalation flow |
| 📘 Legal AI | Clause mapping | CPA 2019: Sections 2(11), 2(28), 2(47), 34(1), 18 |
| 🎯 Strategy | Tone modulation | Strong language vs. neutral, breach of trust emphasis |

## 🧠 Frameworks & Prompt Architectures

- **ReAct prompting** — Iterative legal decision-making (scrutiny replies, jurisdiction fixes)
- **LangChain-style chaining** — Sequential document generation with shared memory context
- **Tool-augmented prompting** — GPT + eDaakhil + RTI + BIS + PDF workflows
- **PromptOps workflow** — Tone debugging, clause checking, annexure linking
- **Human-in-the-loop agent flow** — Legal documents generated via GPT, verified by human

---

## 🔧 Tools & Integrations

- **OpenAI (GPT-4 / ChatGPT Pro)** — Legal draft generation, tone crafting, structure logic
- **eDaakhil Portal** — For court filings, scrutiny replies, annexure sync
- **RTI Portal** — Filing BIS and government queries against Acer
- **PDF Tools (eSign, compression, merge)** — Notarised affidavits, service report, etc.
- **Audio Tools** — Transcript generation + NLP inference
- **OCR + Email PDF Parsing** — Input for LLM summarization
