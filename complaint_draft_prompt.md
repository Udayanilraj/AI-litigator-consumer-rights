Act as a legal assistant specializing in consumer protection law (CPA 2019, India). 

I’m an individual filing a complaint against Acer for unjust warranty denial without inspection. My laptop screen cracked while adjusting angle — no impact or drop occurred.

They denied warranty 4x via mail and 2x by voice, then misled me via service engineer (e.g., fake train accident form via WhatsApp, vague inspection, forced signature request). I filed a grievance via NCH and now want to escalate legally.

Please assist me with:

1. 🧠 **Understanding**:
   - What legal grounds I have under the Consumer Protection Act
   - What forms I need to submit

2. ❓ **Clarifying Questions**:
   - Ask anything you need to fully map the timeline or clarify proof

3. 🧾 **Document Assistance**:
   - Help generate a draft consumer complaint
   - List documents required as annexures

4. 🪙 **Constraints**:
   - I'm handling this alone
   - Prefer zero/low-cost, online approaches
   - Tools available: Call recordings, invoice, mail chains, service report snap, etc.
